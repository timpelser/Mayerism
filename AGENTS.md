# Agent Guidelines for Mayerism Project

## Build Commands
1. **Never run the build command.** The user will always build the project themselves. Do not execute cmake or build commands.

## Code Changes
2. **Do not use mass updating.** When making changes (even large ones), go through the file line by line. Small targeted updates are how you update the code. Use the edit_file tool with precise old_str and new_str values for each change.

## Planning
3. **Write all implementation details directly to the chat.** Do not create any new Markdown files unless explicitly asked to do so.
