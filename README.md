**MAYERISM is an open-source plugin inspired by John Mayer’s signature tones.**
Built on top of the [NeuralAmpModelerPlugin](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin), it focuses on faithfully recreating the feel and response of Mayer’s most iconic amplifiers, paired with a carefully curated pedalboard for expressive, touch-sensitive playing.

## Overview

MAYERISM is designed as a single, cohesive guitar plugin. The goal is not endless options, but a ready-to-go platform that allows players to quickly achieve the inspiring tones of the last true guitar hero, without sacrificing feel, touch, or musical dynamics.

## Features

### Amp Section

* **John Mayer–inspired amp simulation**
  Neural amp modeling based on the tonal characteristics of Mayer’s most famous amplifiers, focusing on:

  * Clean to edge-of-breakup response
  * Touch sensitivity and pick dynamics
  * Smooth midrange and glassy high end

* **NeuralAmpModeler powered**
  Utilizes NAM technology for accurate, high-quality amp behavior rather than multiple interchangeable amp models.

### Integrated Pedal Suite

* **Tube Screamer–style Overdrive**
  Classic mid-forward drive with Drive, Tone, and Level controls

* **Compressor**
  Transparent compression for sustain and control, ideal for clean and blues tones

* **Clean Boost**
  Transparent gain stage for pushing the amp or lifting solos

* **Chorus**
  Subtle modulation for width and movement, suited for clean and lightly driven tones

* **Delay**
  Musical delay for rhythmic repeats and ambient textures

* **Reverb**
  Smooth reverb for space and depth, from subtle room ambience to lush tails

### Tone Shaping & Utilities

* **Tone Stack EQ**
  Bass, Middle, and Treble controls tuned for Mayer-style voicing

* **Noise Gate**
  Controls noise and feedback without affecting playing dynamics

* **Doubler**
  Adds stereo width and depth

* **Input / Output Gain**
  Independent level control for gain staging and plugin integration
